            <div class="title">Cell Simulations with the Marching Cubes Algorithm</div>
            <div class="subtitle">By Lisa Lau and Tyler Wolf Leonhardt</div>

            <div class="heading1">1 - Abstract</div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                The marching cubes algorithm is an algorithm which allows a mesh to be created from a scalar field <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes">[1]</a>. In other words, the algorithm takes a 3-dimensional array of points with certain intensities and creates a mesh which represent a volume of neighbor points above a certain intensity threshold. This algorithm can be used to create many different types of procedurally generated meshes. One of the procedurally generated meshes that this algorithm can create is called a meatball. Metaballs are spherical objects which modify the geometry of other metaballs, sometimes even to the point of fusing, when they are close to each other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaballs">[2]</a>. The geometry created by two metaballs traveling away from each other is roughly similar to that of a cell during mitosis. In the following report we provide information about our implementation of the marching cubes algorithm and describe how we used it to generate a cell-mitosis animation.

            <div class="heading1">2 - The Algorithm</div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                On its own the marching cubes algorithm requires a large amount of code. The implementation of the cell-mitosis was originally implemented using open-source code found online <a href="http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title=MetaBalls">[3]</a>. This algorithm was much too slow for our use and had to be completely rewritten. For simplicity we divided the algorithm across a collection of classes. Classes of importance are described in the subsection, below and the computation itself is described in the following subsection.

            <div class="heading3">2.1.1 - MarchingCubesEnvironment</div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                The environment which the generated mesh can live in. This class allows the number of cubes in the environment to be specified along each axis. Increasing the number of cubes increases the quality of the mesh but the mesh also takes longer to generate. If part of the mesh leaves the bounds specified by the environment it will no longer be visible. After the environment is created, the cubes within it can be indexed as though they were members of an array.

            <div class="heading3">2.1.2 - MarchingEntity</div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                An entity within the environment. This entity gives the points in the environment their intensities. Each entity can generate intensities however it wishes.

            <div class="heading3">2.1.2 - MarchingMetaball</div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                A marching entity which generates intensities using the following equation:

            <div class="paragraph">
                The square magnitude was used so that a square root did not have to be taken for every point. This computation would have been prohibitively expensive. Additionally, the elimination of the floating point division would also have provided a much more computationally efficient equation.

                A cube within the environment with local space coordinates between -0.5 and +0.5 in each direction (X, Y, Z). It consists of 8 points and 12 edges.

                By using the marching cubes algorithm to create metaballs and then applying a shader which supports transparency to the metaball, a simulation of a 3D cell with organelles should be feasible. The resulting should look similar to Figure 1, below.
